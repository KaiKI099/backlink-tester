3. Use the token as password when pushing:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/KaiKI099/backlink-tester.git
   git push -u origin main
   # When prompted for username: KaiKI099
   # When prompted for password: [your-personal-access-token]
   ```

### Option 3: Set up SSH Key

1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"`
2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
